#How this is supposed to function:
#1: Empire builds a building
#2: event 1 fires 
#2a: if the event has not already proceeded to the next step, check what techs they have researched
#2b: by random chance scaling with how many of the T3 building techs they have researched, roll a random chance
#2c: if none of them have been researched, the chance should be zero. if all have been researched, it should be nearly 100%
#2d: fire event 2 after ~8 months
#3: event 2 fires
#3a: give the player 2 choices: tall or wide
#3b: give special project depending on which was chosen
#3c: on completion, give tech for T4
